# AutoForum: Collaborative Knowledge Enhancement

## What is live theory?

People are not very good at predicting long term change, and change at scale. Even those who said "the internet would be transformative" couldn't predict online classes, remote work, MMOs and VRChat and social media algorithms, the extent to which a technology infiltrating into society changes society.
AI is currently at this stage. We have access to much more capabilities than we're reasonably using. Live theory is a framework for designing interfaces in order to use the level of intelligence we have available to us in order to make more human-friendly tools and enable human creativity and collaboration.

"Live interfaces" have the goal of allowing users to express their preferences, which could be quite specific, but without the need to rely on a specific formal structure. Interfaces which could adapt and make use of the level of knowledge about you currently found in something like the Youtube recommendation algorithm, but with the goal of fulfilling your actual preferences rather than exploiting them.

## What is this project?

AutoForum is an experiment in AI-assisted collaboration and wiki/forum-like structures. We were inspired by Sofi van Hanen's [autoblog](https://github.com/sofvanh/autoblog), which provides additional background context. 

Current online discussions and knowledge platforms have a fundamental limitation: they rely on explicit user actions to improve content. On platforms like Wikipedia, tags like [citation needed] or [clarify] require another human to manually hunt down references or rephrase sentences. On forums like LessWrong or Reddit, feedback is limited to comments and votes, which don't directly improve the original content.

Our vision is to create a system where readers can easily express reactions and suggestions through a simple tagging interface, and AI agents process these tags to automatically improve the content. This allows the collective intelligence of the community to directly enhance the quality of information, while also enabling content to adapt to individual preferences through personalization.

## Examples

Let's explore a couple of sample paragraphs that demonstrate how tagging might work:

### Example 1

Nuclear fission was discovered in December 1938 by some German chemists and physicists. Fission is a type of nuclear reaction or radioactive decay process. The fission process often releases a large amount of energy. Scientists already knew about alpha decay and beta decay, but fission was very important for other reasons.

### Example 2

NumPy is a very important Python library, which is necessary for many scientific applications which rely on its features. It allows certain computations to be run in C, which allows them to be run much faster as C is a lower-level language. C was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Richie but is still used in many applications today. NumPy was first developed in the 1990s in order to offer an open-source competitor for the proprietary software MATLAB.

## Future Development

While our current demo focuses on showing the core concept, we're exploring several key areas for future development:

- Author moderation options to control how much community input is incorporated
- More intuitive ways to express improvement suggestions
- Better AI understanding of community consensus 
- Testing with actual multi-user collaborations

We believe this approach can significantly improve how communities collectively build and refine knowledge online, making collaborative content creation more efficient and effective.
