This project builds on Sofi van Hanen's autoblog, extending beyond a single user's personalization to a wiki-like system inspired by LessWrong's reactions system, where users can mark sections as needing improvement, or add their feedback and commentary in the form of unstructured notes, and those comments will be expanded on.

In the demo you're seeing, you can highlight sections of text where you'd like to suggest changes, tag them with common responses such as "important" or "needs examples" or with custom prompts, and once you're done tagging press the "contribute" button in the sidebar on the left-hand side and your reactions will inspire edits from the AI. You can toggle the "contributions" switch on and off to see the original or edited versions.

The current prompt is designed to limit the AI's editing to the sections you designate, to avoid it taking "editorial license" with sections of writing that users already think are successful.

The next major stage of development is probably thinking about this in terms of using it for an actual community - when might pieces of commentary that almost all users would support become part of the "default version" of a text?
