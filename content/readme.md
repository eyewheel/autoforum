## What is live theory?

People are not very good at predicting long term change, and change at scale. Even those who said "the internet would be transformative" couldn't predict online classes, remote work, MMOs and VRChat and social media algorithms, the extent to which a technology infiltrating into society changes society.
AI is currently at this stage. We have access to much more capabilities than we're reasonably using. Live theory is a framework for designing interfaces in order to use the level of intelligence we have available to us in order to make more human-friendly tools and enable human creativity and collaboration.

"Live interfaces" have the goal of allowing users to express their preferences, which could be quite specific, but without the need to rely on a specific formal structure. Interfaces which could adapt and make use of the level of knowledge about you currently found in something like the Youtube recommendation algorithm, but with the goal of fulfilling your actual preferences rather than exploiting them.

## What is this project?

This project is an experiment in AI-assisted collaboration and wiki/forum-like structures. We were inspired by Sofi van Hanen's [autoblog](https://github.com/sofvanh/autoblog), which provides a little more background context. Readers of an article might have quick, informal thoughts about ways the article could be improved - thoughts that currently might be best expressed with Wikipedia's \[citation needed\] or \[clarify\] tags. However, even on Wikipedia, those tags are dependent on another user coming by and putting in the grunt work to hunt down references or rephrase sentences. What if readers could express those "wishes" and vague unformed suggestions for improvement, and improvements would automatically be made along those lines?

## How does all this work?

Let's take a look at some short paragraphs.

Nuclear fission was discovered in December 1938 by some German chemists and physicists. Fission is a type of nuclear reaction or radioactive decay process. The fission process often releases a large amount of energy. Scientists already knew about alpha decay and beta decay, but fission was very important for other reasons.

NumPy is a very important Python library, which is necessary for many scientific applications which rely on its features. It allows certain computations to be run in C, which allows them to be run much faster as C is a lower-level language. C was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Richie but is still used in many applications today. NumPy was first developed in the 1990s in order to offer an open-source competitor for the proprietary software MATLAB.

Are there improvements you would like to make to one of these paragraphs? Do you see mistakes? Select the text, and options will pop up to suggest improvements. Then hit the "contribute" button in the left-hand sidebar, and the AI will make edits based on your suggestions.

The more users agree with a suggestion, the more that suggestion will be taken into account. The "demo mode" allows you to simulate how the AI will make edits if a large number of users supports a suggestion, by adding multiple responses.

## Where do you plan to go with this?
